### Product Name (working title)  
**HackDay Central**  

→ The internal **AI Maturity Accelerator** 
 
(or: “the place where AI stops being a solo experiment and starts becoming how we work”)

### One-liner purpose  
A permanent, year-round platform that turns scattered AI experiments by early adopters into **reusable, trusted assets** that the rest of the organization can safely copy → paste → adapt → ship — and makes the whole adoption curve visibly bend faster.

### Core job-to-be-done (the product actually solves these problems)

1. **Early adopters are doing amazing things → nobody else knows / reuses it**  
   → Library + AI Arsenal + reuse tracking + impact stories fix this

2. **Late majority wants to use AI but fears looking stupid / wasting time / doing it wrong**  
   → Anonymous submission, sandbox mode, one-click mentor matching, curated starter kits, AI-assisted idea submission

3. **Most internal innovation platforms become ghost towns after 3 months**  
   → No points for “trying AI” — only credit for reusable outputs + real workflow change  
   → Strong social proof loop (badges, leaderboards, impact stories, mentor champion visibility)

4. **Leadership has no credible signal whether AI is actually moving the needle**  
   → AI Maturity Dashboard shows % regular contributors, reuse rates, workflow transformation %, early-adopter concentration (Gini), frontline vs. leadership gap

### Target users & how the value flows (very classic pull dynamic)

| Persona              | Primary goal                              | How the product helps them win                                   | How they help everyone else win                     |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **AI Early Adopter / Power User** | Get credit, influence, reduce duplication | Badges, leaderboards, most-reused author visibility, mentor champion status | Seeds 70%+ of the reusable assets                   |
| **AI Curious / Comfortable**      | Experiment safely, find proven patterns   | AI Arsenal, recommendations, mentor pairing, anonymous mode     | Starts copying → creates first reuses               |
| **Late Majority / Newbie**        | Stop feeling behind without high risk     | Starter kits, AI-assisted submit, “copy first” UX, 15-min mentor | Creates the “everyone is doing it” social proof     |
| **Team Leads / Managers**         | See if team is actually adopting AI       | Maturity scoreboard, team-level views (anonymized), reuse stats | Sponsors high-reuse assets → pushes standardisation |
| **Innovation / L&D / Enablement** | Scale enablement without 1:1 hand-holding | Mentor matching capacity controls, automated nudges, graduation flows | Curates Arsenal, verifies assets, runs nudges       |

### Core product promise (the North Star sentence)

**“If an AI technique saves one person 10 hours a week, we make sure the next 100 people can copy it in under 10 minutes — and leadership can see the compounding effect in real time.”**

### What makes this feel different from “just another internal Confluence + Jira experiment”

| Dimension                   | Typical internal “innovation hub”                     | HackDay Central (this product)                                 |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Credit model**            | Points for ideas / participation                      | Credit only for **reusable outputs** + workflow change         |
| **Discovery**               | Keyword search, tags                                  | Hybrid AI search + semantic recommendations + “similar assets” |
| **Trust signal**            | None / likes                                          | Verified status + reuse count + verified-by name               |
| **Late majority entry**     | “Here’s the docs, good luck”                          | Anonymous sandbox + mentor pairing + role-based starter kits   |
| **Social proof engine**     | All-hands shout-outs (if lucky)                       | Built-in badges, impact stories feed, mentor champion leaderboard |
| **Adoption metric**         | “We ran X hack days”                                  | % regular AI contributors + reuse rate + Gini concentration    |

### Key user flows (the magic loops)

**Loop 1 – The compounding reuse flywheel**  
Early adopter → creates high-quality prompt/agent/template → submits to Library → gets verified → reused in 3+ projects → badge + leaderboard → more visibility → more early adopters motivated → more quality assets

**Loop 2 – The pull-through loop for late majority**  
Newbie sees impact story (“saved 12 h/week”) → clicks through to asset → one-click copy → pastes into own project → leaves thank-you / small improvement → becomes visible helper → eventually submits own improvement

**Loop 3 – Mentor distribution loop**  
Power user sets mentor capacity = 4 slots/month → gets mentor-champion badge → late majority requests 15-min pairing → learns fast → copies pattern → becomes helper themselves → frees up original mentor capacity

### Success looks like (what you put on the quarterly review slide)

After 9–12 months:

- **>50%** of knowledge workers have made at least one AI contribution in the last 30 days  
- **Early adopters** (top ~15%) have seeded **≥70%** of the most-reused assets  
- Library **reuse rate** is trending up (distinct projects / asset)  
- **Gini coefficient** of AI contribution distribution < 0.7 (not hyper-concentrated)  
- **≥20–30%** of graduating projects mark “workflow transformed”  
- Mentor requests are **saturating capacity** (good signal — people want help)

### Biggest product risks (what keeps the PM up at night)

1. Library stays empty or low-quality → no reuse flywheel starts  
   → Mitigation: seed 20–30 very high-quality items day 1 + strong verification path

2. Badges / leaderboards create gaming instead of real value  
   → Mitigation: anti-gaming rules already in (distinct projects/users, quality gates)

3. Late majority never shows up (stays too scary)  
   → Mitigation: anonymous mode + sandbox + AI-assisted ultra-low-friction entry

4. Leadership ignores the dashboard → no cultural reinforcement  
   → Mitigation: make dashboard dead-simple + tie to existing OKR / all-hands narratives

### One-sentence positioning statement (for internal comms / slack announcement)

“HackDay Central turns early adopters' pioneering AI efforts into shared, reusable knowledge for the whole organization, and provides a safe, welcoming platform for all others to participate, contribute their own ideas, experiment securely, and build expertise together”
