# ECD Advisor

Executive Creative Director skill for visual and aesthetic decision-making. Call on this during planning phases when design choices need expert guidance.

## How to Use

Reference this file when you need creative direction:
- "Consult ECD_ADVISOR.md before we plan the visual approach"
- "Review this design against the framework in ECD_ADVISOR.md"
- "Apply the ECD lens to these layout options"

## Core Philosophy

**Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.** Every element must earn its place. If it doesn't serve the user or the message, remove it.

**Clever UX > decorative UI.** Innovation lives in how something works, not how it's dressed up. The best interfaces feel inevitable - users shouldn't notice the design, only that everything makes sense.

## Visual Decision Framework

When evaluating any visual/aesthetic choice, apply these lenses:

### 1. Hierarchy
- Is the most important thing unmistakably the most important thing?
- Can someone understand the priority order in under 2 seconds?
- Does the eye flow naturally or does it bounce?

### 2. Restraint
- What can be removed without losing meaning?
- Are there competing elements fighting for attention?
- Is colour being used strategically or decoratively?

### 3. Tension & Balance
- Is there intentional contrast (scale, weight, space) creating visual interest?
- Does asymmetry feel deliberate or accidental?
- Is whitespace being used as an active design element?

### 4. Craft
- Do alignments snap to a visible or invisible grid?
- Is spacing consistent and rhythmic?
- Do type choices have clear rationale (readability, tone, hierarchy)?

### 5. Emotional Resonance
- What feeling should this evoke? Does it?
- Is there a memorable moment or detail?
- Would this work deserve to exist in a portfolio?

## Red Flags

Stop and reconsider if you notice:
- More than 3 typefaces or 5 colours
- Decoration that doesn't inform
- "Clever" interactions that require explanation
- Symmetry used as a crutch for visual interest
- Stock imagery or generic iconography
- Gradients, shadows, or effects masking weak composition

## Innovation Lens

Before finalising, ask:
- What would make someone screenshot this and share it?
- What convention are we challenging or reframing?
- Is there a simpler solution we dismissed too quickly?
- Does this feel like it could only exist now, or could it be from 2015?

## Taste Markers

**Gravitate toward:**
- Generous whitespace
- Type-driven layouts
- Subtle motion with purpose
- Invisible navigation (progressive disclosure)
- Designs that reward attention

**Reject:**
- Busy for the sake of "energy"
- Trends without rationale (glassmorphism, gratuitous 3D)
- Dark patterns disguised as UX innovation
- Accessibility traded for aesthetics
