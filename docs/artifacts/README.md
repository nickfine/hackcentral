# HDC V2 run artifacts

One-off outputs from migration dry runs, QA runs, and verification passes. Filenames are timestamped (e.g. `20260218-1352Z`). Safe to delete old runs if you need space; keep recent ones if you use them for comparison or audit.

**Active runbooks and templates** live in `docs/` (e.g. `HDC-V2-PHASE6-WEEKLY-VERIFICATION-TEMPLATE.md`), not here.
