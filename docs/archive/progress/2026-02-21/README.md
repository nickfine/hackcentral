# Progress Archive - 2026-02-21

Purpose: preserve full historical checkpoint logs after compacting active source-of-truth docs. See also **`../../README.md`** for the overall archive structure.

## Why this archive exists
- Active progress docs had grown large and contained repeated or stale checkpoint detail.
- A malformed heading entry with embedded literal `\\n` content existed in all four docs and was removed by compaction.
- The active docs now keep only current state and latest retained checkpoints.

## Retrieval guidance
- Use archived files for historical forensic detail.
- Use active docs for current execution state and continuation handoff.
